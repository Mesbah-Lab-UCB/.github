# MESBAH LAB AT UC BERKELEY
## LEARNING-BASED ANALYSIS AND PREDICTIVE CONTROL OF UNCERTAIN SYSTEMS

A GitHub organization for the Mesbah Lab, [Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/cbe) at the University of California, Berkeley. 

Our interdisciplinary research lies at the intersection of optimal control theory, machine learning, applied mathematics, and their application to analysis and control of complex chemical and biomolecular systems. 
In particular, we are interested in developing computational methods and control theory that enable learning, analysis, and predictive control of uncertain systems. 
We employ these methods to facilitate high-performance control of systems spanning from (bio)molecular processes to manufacturing and energy systems whose dynamics cannot be modeled accurately or are intrinsically uncertain.
